# Check-Yo-Self
Check Yo' Self is an application for users to keep track of their to-do lists. A user can create new tasks that display on the sidebar, and delete them before making an official to-do list. The to-do list appears on the main portion of the screen, and the user can then check off items as their completed, mark certain lists as urgent, and remove the list once all items have been completed.

This is a great project for a developer to hone their skills in javascript, localStorage and comp creation using semantic HTML and CSS. Feel free to take a look at my code, my [page](https://taylornoeljordan.github.io/Check-Yo-Self/), and experiment for yourself. Enjoy!
